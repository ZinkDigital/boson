## Introduction to Boson

Boson is a library, written in Scala with both Scala and Java APIs, built to extract and inject data to and from various ‘wire encodings’. It currently implements two input codecs, JSON documents encoded in the form of UTF8 strings, and BSON documents encoded in the form of binary arrays.

Through the use of Shapeless, Boson allows the use of user created classes as data extraction/injection types.

In the following points we show how to use Boson in both Scala and Java in a QuickStart Guide.


<div id='id-quickStartGuide'/>  

## QuickStart Guide  

Boson is available through the Central Maven Repository, divided into 3 parts, [BosonScala](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.zink/bosonscala), [BosonJava](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.zink/bosonjava) and [BosonCore](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.zink/bosoncore).  
To include Boson in your projects you need to add the dependencies listed bellow.

For SBT users, add the following to your build.sbt:
```scala
//For the Scala API
libraryDependencies += “io.zink” % “bosonscala” % “0.5.0”
```
```scala
//For the Java API
libraryDependencies += “io.zink” % “bosonjava” % “0.5.0"
```

For Maven users, add the following to your pom.xml:
```xml
<!--For the Scala API-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.zink</groupId>
    <artifactId>bosonsala</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```
```xml
<!--For the Java API-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.zink</groupId>
    <artifactId>bosonjava</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Boson  

A "Boson" is an object created when constructing an extractor/injector that includes either a Bson encoded as an Array[Byte] or a Json encoded as a String in a Netty buffer and processes it according to a given expression, traversing the buffer only once.

<div id='id-quickStartGuideScala'/>  

### Scala

<div id='id-bosonExtractionScala'/>

#### Extraction  
Extraction requires a "BsonPath" expression (see [Documentation](#documentation) for examples and syntax), an encoded BSON and an Higher-Order Function. The Extractor instance is built only once and can be reused multiple times to extract from different encoded BSON.  

```scala  
//Encode Bson:  
val validBson : Array[Byte] = bsonEvent.encode.getBytes  

//BsonPath expression:  
val expression: String = "fridge[1].fanVelocity"  

// Want to put the result onto a Stream.  
val valueStream : ValueStream = ValueStream()  

//Simple Extractor:  
val boson: Boson = Boson.extractor(expression, (in: Long) => {  
  valueStream.add(in);  
})  

//Trigger extraction with encoded Bson:  
boson.go(validBson)  

// Function will be called as a result of calling 'go'  
```  
<div id='id-bosonInjectionScala'/>  

#### Injection  
Injection requires a "BsonPath" expression (see [Documentation](#documentation) table for examples and syntax), an encoded BSON and an Higher-Order Function. The returned result is a Future[Array[Byte]]. The Injector instance is built only once and can be reused to inject different encoded BSON.  

```scala  
//Encode Bson:  
val validBsonArray: Array[Byte] = bsonEvent.encode.getBytes

//BsonPath expression:  
val expression: String = "Store..name"  

//Simple Injector:  
val boson: Boson = Boson.injector(expression, (in: String) => "newName")  

//Trigger injection with encoded Bson:  
val result: Future[Array[Byte]] = boson.go(validBsonArray)

// Function will be called as a result of calling 'go'
```  
<div id='id-bosonFuseScala'>  

#### Fusion  
**Note: Fusion in Boson is not implemented efficiently yet.**

Fusion requires a [Boson Extractor](#id-bosonExtractionScala) and a [Boson Injector](#id-bosonInjectionScala) or two Boson of the same type. The order in
which fuse is applied is left to the discretion of the user. This fusion is executed sequentially at the moment.  

```scala  
//First step is to construct both Boson.injector and Boson.extractor by providing the necessary arguments.  
val validatedByteArray: Array[Byte] = bsonEvent.encode.getBytes

val expression = "name"  

val ext: Boson = Boson.extractor(expression, (in: BsValue) => {  
  // Use 'in' value, this is the value extracted.  
})  

val inj: Boson = Boson.injector(expression, (in: String) => "newName")  

//Then call fuse() on injector or extractor, it returns a new BosonObject.  
val fused: Boson = ext.fuse(inj)  

//Finally call go() providing the byte array or a ByteBuffer on the new Boson object.  
val result: Future[Array[Byte]] = fused.go(validatedByteArray)
```  
<div id='id-quickStartGuideJava'/>  

### Java  
To work in Java, for Maven users, it is also necessary to add the following dependency to the pom.xml of your project:  

```xml  
<dependency>  
    <groupId>io.zink</groupId>  
    <artifactId>boson</artifactId>  
    <version>0.5</version>  
</dependency>  
```  
<div id='id-extractionJava'/>  

#### Extraction
Extraction requires a "BsonPath" expression (see [Documentation](#documentation) table for examples and syntax), an encoded BSON and a lambda expression. The Extractor instance is built only once and can be reused multiple times to extract from different encoded BSON.  

```java  
//Encode Bson:  
byte[] validatedByteArray = bsonEvent.encode().getBytes();  

//BsonPath expression:  
String expression = "Store..SpecialEditions[@Extra]";  

// Want to put the result onto a Stream.  
ValueStream valueStream = ValueStream()  

//Simple Extractor:  
Boson boson = Boson.extractor(expression, (Object obj)-> {  
   valueStream.add(in);
});  

//Trigger extraction with encoded Bson:  
boson.go(validatedByteArray);  

// Function will be called as a result of calling 'go'  
```  
<div id='id-injectionJava'/>  

#### Injection  
Injection requires a "BsonPath" expression (see [Documentation](#documentation) table for examplesand syntax), an encoded BSON and a lambda expression. The returned result is a CompletableFuture<byte[]>. The Injector instance is built only once and can be reused to inject different encoded BSON.  

```java  
//Encode Bson:  
byte[] validatedByteArray = bsonEvent.encode().getBytes();  

//BsonPath expression:  
String expression = "..Store.[2 until 4]";  

//Simple Injector:  
Boson boson = Boson.injector(expression,  (Object in) -> {  
   in.toUpperCase();  
   return in;  
});  

//Trigger injection with encoded Bson:  
byte[] result = boson.go(validatedByteArray).join();  
```  
<div id='id-bosonFuseJava'/>  

#### Fusion
**Note: Fusion in Boson is not implemented efficiently yet.**

Fusion requires  a [Boson Extractor](#id-bosonExtractionScala) and a
[Boson Injector](#id-bosonInjectionScala) or two Boson of the same type. The order in
which fuse is applied is left to the discretion of the user. This fusion is executed
sequentially at the moment.  

```java  
//First step is to construct both Boson.injector and Boson.extractor by providing the necessary arguments.  
final byte[] validatedByteArray  = bsonEvent.encode().array();  

final String expression = "name";  

final Boson ext = Boson.extractor(expression, (in: BsValue) -> {  
  // Use 'in' value, this is the value extracted.  
});  

final Boson inj = Boson.injector(expression, (in: String) -> "newName");  

//Then call fuse() on injector or extractor, it returns a new BosonObject.  
final Boson fused = ext.fuse(inj);  

//Finally call go() providing the byte array or a ByteBuffer on the new Boson object.  
final byte[] result = fused.go(validatedByteArray).join();  
```

## BsonPath  

BosonPath expressions target a Bson structure with the same logic JsonPath expressions target a JSON structure and XPath target an XML document. Unlike in JsonPath, there is no reference of a "root member object", instead if you want to specify a path starting from the root the expression must begin with a dot (example: `.key`).

BsonPath expressions use the dot-notation: `key1.key2[0].key3`.  

Expressions whose path doesn't necessarily start from the root can be expressed in two ways:  
* No dot: ` key`  
* Two dots: `..key`  

<div id='id-operators'/>  

### Operators  

Operator | Description  
---------|----------  
`.` | Child.  
`..` | Deep scan. Available anywhere a name is required.  
`@` | Current node.  
`[<number> ((to,until) <number>)]` | Array index or indexes.  
`[@<key>]` | Filter expression.  
`[first \| end \| all]` | Array index through condition.
`*` | Wildcard. Available anywhere a name is required.

### Path Examples and Comparison with JsonPath  
Given the json  
```json  
{  
   "Store":{  
      "Book":[  
           {  
               "Title":"Java",

                   }  
                ]  
           },  
           {

                       "Price":38  
                   }  
                ]  
           }  
           ],  
       "Hat":[  
            {  
                "Price":48,  
                "Color":"Red"  
            },  
            {  
                "Price":35,  
                "Color":"White"  
            },  
            {  
                "Price":38,  
                "Color":"Blue"  
            }  
        ]  
    }  
}  
```  
BsonPath | JsonPath | Result
---------|----------|-------  
`.Store` | `$.Store`  | All Stores and what they contain
`.Store.Book[@Price]` | `$.Store.Book[?(@.Price)]` | All Books that contain the tag "Price"
`Book[@Price]..Title` | `$..Book[?(@.Price)]..Title` | All the "Titles" of the Books, available anywhere in the json, that contain the tag "Price"
`Book[1]` | `$..Book[1]` | The second Book of all the Book arrays available in the json
`Book[0 to end]..Price` | `$..Book[:]..Price` | All the values of the tag "Price" from all the Books, available in the json, and the objects they contain
`Book[all].*..Title` | `$..Book[:].*..Title` | All the values of the tag "Title" if the objects contained in Book, available anywhere in the json
`Book[0 until end]..Price` | `$..Book[:-1]..Price` | All the values of the tag "Price" from the Books, available in the json, and the objects they contain, excluding the last Book
`Book[first until end].*..Title` | `$..Book[:-1].*..Title` | All the values of the tag "Title" if the objects contained in each Book, available anywhere in the json, excluding the last Book
`.*` | `$.*` | All the objects contained in Store
`Book.*.[first to end]` | `$..Book.*.[:]` | An Array contained in all the objects in Book, available anywhere in the json(considering the case above, nothing)
`.Store..Book[1 until end]..SpecialEditions[@Price]` | `$.Store..Book[1:-1]..SpecialEditions[?(@.Price)]` | All the Special Editions, available anywhere in the Book, of Book that contain the tag "Price" from the second Book until the end, excluding
`Bo*k`, `*ok` or `Bo*`  | `Non existent.` | Halfkeys of Book that return all Books
`*ok[@Pri*]..SpecialEd*.Price` | `Non existent.` | Prices of Halfkey of SpecialEditions,available anywhere in Book, of Halfkey of Book that contain the Halfkey of Price

**Note: JsonPath doesn't support the *halfkey* (`B*ok`).**


## Java Profiler

Boson is a library that relies on high performance BSON/JSON data manipulation, and so performance monitoring is of paramount importance. The chosen java profiler is [YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/) for being a supporter of open source projects and one of the most innovative and intelligent tools for profiling [Java](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/) & [.NET](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/) applications as well .
